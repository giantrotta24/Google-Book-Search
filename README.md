# Google-Book-Search

## Application Concept: 
In this activity, I created a React-based Google Books Search application. My application uses React components, helper/util functions, and React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express, and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later. Each book will include a link that directs you to the Google Book listing.
